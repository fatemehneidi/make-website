            <h1>Iranian cuisine:</h1>
            <p class="para">Although Iranian cuisine has been influenced by Arab and subcontinental cooking methods, it is largely based on the geography and local produce of Iran. Another name for it is Persian cuisine, which has expanded due to the historical name of Iran in the West.Rice is a staple in the Iranian diet, and meat (mostly lamb) plays a significant role in almost every Iranian meal. Vegetables are important in the Iranian diet, and onions are used in almost every dish. Livestock farming has been a long-standing part of the country's economy, and dairy products such as milk, cheese, and especially yogurt, are commonly found on Iranian tables. Authentic Iranian cuisine favors creating subtle flavors and preparing dishes with relatively simple ingredients, such as stews and various types of kebabs. The most prominent spice used in Iran is saffron, but many other flavorings, including lime, mint, turmeric, and rosewater, are used in Iranian cuisine, as are ingredients like pomegranate and walnuts.</p>
