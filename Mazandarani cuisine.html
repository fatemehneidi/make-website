            <h1>Iranian calligraphy:</h1>
            <p class="para">Iranian painting (Persian Miniature) is a type of delicate and intricate painting from Iran that was mostly used in the past for literary, scientific, and medical book illustration, or made separately (illuminated manuscript). Today, it has expanded beyond the realm of book illustration. The comprehensive name that encompasses all aspects is "Persian Painting". After the West became familiar with Eastern art of painting, they also used the term "miniature" for Iranian paintings due to their similarity in size. Iranian painting, in terms of philosophical and aesthetic foundation, differs from Chinese and Japanese miniatures, and technically differs only in size from European miniatures. Islamic Iranian painting flourished from the 14th century AD (8th century AH) to the 17th century AD (11th century AH), but the remaining images and paintings from the pre-Islamic period until the time of the Mongol invasion, as well as works of mural painting, curtain painting, pen holder painting, and the like in the closer centuries, are other, but less recognized, aspects of Iranian painting.</p>
